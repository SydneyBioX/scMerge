## Introduction 

This is a benchmarking single-cell data comprising of 3 different human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. This experiment was designed induce different batch effects into the data. 

**Integration challenge**

+ Prior to integration, there is a strong separation effect by multiple batch effects.
+ One of the batch effects is the different protocols with significant depth differences. 
+ The experimental design poses extra difficulties as cell lines were cultured separatedly and the same batch was processed in 3 different ways.

## Integrated `scMerge` data

+ Data availability: [CellBench Data (in RData format)](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/yingxinl/wwwnb/scMergeData/cellBench_scMerge.rds)

+ `scMerge` parameters for integration:

    - Unsupervised scMerge
    - kmeans K = (3,3,3)
    - Negative controls are human scSEG
