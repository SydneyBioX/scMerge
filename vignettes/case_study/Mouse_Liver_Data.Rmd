## Introduction 

This is a mouse liver single-cell data comprising of 4 different experiments with 3 different protocols.

**Integration challenge**

+ Prior to integration, there is a strong separation effect by batches. 
+ The liver cell developments should have a clear trajectory, this biological process was not clear from the pre-integrated data. In the `scMerge`-integrated, this trajectory was estimated with higher degree of biological interpretability.

Some remarks: 

+ To combine the four liver scRNA-seq datasets, we used a semi-supervised approach by considering the developmental stages as the wanted variation to identify the pseudo-replicates. Note that the cells of the four liver datasets are from different fetal mouse liver developmental stages (E9.5-E17.5). To identify the pseudo-replicates corresponding to the hepatoblasts, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, we used three known markers of hepatoblasts and cholangiocytes, Alb, Afp and Epcam, to guide the `scMerge` algorithm. The sets of pseudo-replicates that are highly expressed the markers are further split according to the developmental stages. 


+ In addition to integrating 4 scRNA-Seq datasets, `scMerge` revealed a novel result: We constructed the cell trajectories with cells corresponding to the E17.5 time point of GSE90047 removed. We found that the trajectory associated with `scMerge` is most consistent with the full Liver data collection and agrees with current literature, while other methods tended to generate extraneous branches with the subset of the Liver data collection. 

+ We further performed SC3 on the `scMerge` integrated data (k=9). We found that the SC3 clustering results have high concordance with the original cell types. 



## Integrated `scMerge` data

+ Data availability: [Mouse Liver Data (in RData format)](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/yingxinl/wwwnb/scMergeData/liver_scMerge.rds)

+ `scMerge` parameters for integration: 

    - semi-supervised scMerge
    - kmeans K = (6,2,3,3)
    - Negative controls are mouse scSEG
    - WV = developmental stage 
    - WV_marker = "Afp","Alb","Epcam"
