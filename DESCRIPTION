Description: Like all gene expression data, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data suffers from 
    batch effects and other unwanted variations that makes accurate biological interpretations difficult. 
    The scMerge method leverages factor analysis, stably expressed genes (SEGs) and (pseudo-) replicates to 
    remove unwanted variations and merge multiple scRNA-Seq data. 
    This package contains all the necessary functions in the 
    scMerge pipeline, including the identification of SEGs, replication-identification methods, and 
    merging of scRNA-Seq data.
